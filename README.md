# .dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository.

I am using `stow` to manage the files together with git.

Check out [this](http://www.garin.io/dotfiles-with-stow) or [this guide](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/) if you are interested in how I have done implemented it.
